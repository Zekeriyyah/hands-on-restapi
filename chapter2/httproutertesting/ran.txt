If you observe the code, we used /usr/local/go/bin/go as the Go
executable location because it is the Go compiler location in Mac OS X.
While executing exec.Command, you should give the absolute path of the
executable. So, if you are working on an Ubuntu machine or Windows,
use the path to your installed Go executable. On Linux machines, you can
easily find that out by using the $ which go command.
